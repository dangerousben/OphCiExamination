1,"Normal","normal_risk",10,"A normal patient who has no strong evidence of glaucoma at present.
i) Glaucoma suspects on the basis of 2 unreliable VFs with no other signs or risk factors for glaucoma
ii) Glaucoma suspects on the basis of mildly suspicious ONH with no other signs or risk factors for glaucoma
iii) Untreated OHT patients with no other risk factors for glaucoma in whom the IOP has not exceeded 25mmHg or the CCT < 555microns","None","Discharge"
2,"Stable","stable_risk",20,"A stable glaucoma patient at low risk of significant visual loss in their lifetime.
i) OHT patients (not in ‘normal’ category): On topical IOP lowering therapy, have risk factors for developing glaucoma;
ii) Glaucoma suspects (not in ‘normal’ category): where the IOP is within target levels;
iii) Glaucoma patients with ‘mild’ and stable VF loss: loss is less than -10dB, reliable VF has not changed by more than -5dB
iv) and central vision is not threatened: no defects at the 5% level within 5 degrees of fixation, no total deviation points within 5 degrees fixation of less than -10dB","12 months","Annual review"
3,"Low Risk","low_risk",30,"A low risk glaucoma patient who may be at some risk of significant visual loss in their lifetime.
i) Glaucoma patients aged under 70 years;
ii) Glaucoma patients with a VA of 6/12 or worse in their better eye
Iii) Glaucoma patients with worse than -10dB total deviation defects in either eye
iv) Glaucoma patients where 1 or more points within 5 degrees of fixation have a total deviation of -11dB or worse or have a new spot within this area with a defect at the 5% level","6 months","Routine review"
4,"Unstable / High Risk","high_risk",40,"An unstable glaucoma patient who is at risk of significant visual loss.
i) Glaucoma patients in whom the IOP is uncontrolled: IOP is over target level
ii) Glaucoma patients where the VF defect is progressing
Iii) Glaucoma patients where central vision is threatened: where 2 or more new spots have appeared within the central 5 degrees at the 5% level
iv) Glaucoma patients where the ONH has shown signs of progression
