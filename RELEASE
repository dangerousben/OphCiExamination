Release History
===============

This document is intended to summarise the changes made for each release. It should be noted that this document was only introduced with version 1.4, and therefore doesn't cover earlier releases.

1.4.9
-----
+ support for shortcode macro to visual acuity findings - correct the eye order to visual acuity findings.
+ updates/additions of shortcodes for DR Grading, injection management and clinical management
+ additional fields and enhancements to the OCT element

1.4.8
-----
+ Max CRT field in OCT is now optional

1.4.5
-----
+ Added clinical maculopathy to DR Grading.

1.4.4
-----
+ Require a patient to have a diabetic type diagnosis for DR Grading. If one has not been defined on the patient, a radio button form element is provided to set this inline.

1.4.3
-----

+ Change the Injection Management Complex element to have a no treatment flag for each eye, rather than across both. Note that the migration for this only really works one way. Furthermore, it will assume that any element marked for no treatment should be set for no treatment on both eyes. You may wish to manually review any changes. (this element was introduced in 1.4.0, so should be a limited issue).
